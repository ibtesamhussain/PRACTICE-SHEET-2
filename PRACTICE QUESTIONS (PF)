Python User Define Function Practice Activity - 2


Question 1: Create a function to find the following: If the base of triangle is 3 cm long and its equilateral triangle and the radius of circle is 1.5 cm then find the area of triangle shaded.

proj

In [21]:
import math
def area(r):
    x=(((math.sqrt(3))/4)*(3**2))*6
    x1=(math.pi)*(r**2)

Question 2: Create a function which can read a dictionary of your family members such as 5 members. 1 Abbu, 1 Ammi, 2 Brothers 1 Sister.
